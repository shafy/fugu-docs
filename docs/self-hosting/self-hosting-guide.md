# Self-Hosting Guide

Fugu is open-source and free to self-host. There are no feature restrictions when you're self-hosting. Fugu is a pretty standard Ruby on Rails app and uses a PostgreSQL database. Therefore, you are free to host it however you like.

Head over to our [self-hosting guide on GitHub](https://github.com/shafy/fugu/blob/main/SELFHOSTING.md) to get more detailed instructions on how to self-host Fugu using our Docker setup or a managed service like Heroku.
