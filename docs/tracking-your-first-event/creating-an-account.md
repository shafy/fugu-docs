# Creating an Account

You can create a Fugu account for free. Just navigate to the [Sign up form](https://app.fugu.lol/users/sign_up) and enter your email and desired password.

You can start tracking events in test mode with your test API key that you can find in your project's settings. Test events are deleted automatically after 14 days. If you're ready to start tracking events in live mode, make sure to subscribe to Fugu first.
